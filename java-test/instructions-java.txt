to run:
you can use the jar in "java-test -> out -> artifacts -> backend-coding-test.jar".

simply run in a terminal window "java -jar backend-coding-test.jar"

if you want to re-generate the jar you can do so.

I built the project using IDEA so just import backend-coding-test to IDEA and then go to "build -> build artifacts"
and it will build the jar again.
