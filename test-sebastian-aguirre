to run it:
java -jar untitled3.jar

you need a mysql database in
localhost:3306/test
user -> root
pass -> root

--------------------------------

for the part of showing the vat you would need to take this table in default.html

<tr ng-repeat="expense in expenses">
<td>{{expense.date | date:'dd MMM yyyy'}}</td>
<td>{{expense.amount | currency:"&pound;"}}</td>
<td>{{expense.reason}}</td>
</tr>

and add the "vat" property of ExpenseBean.java

<td>{{expense.vat}}</td>
